        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>There are various individual skills and team tactics needed to play effective football. 
           Football is in theory a very simple game, as illustrated by Kevin Keegan's famous assertion that his tactics for winning a match were to "score more goals than the opposition". 
           However, well-organised and well-prepared teams are often seen beating teams with supposedly more skillful players, even over time.
